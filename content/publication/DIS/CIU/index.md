**Abstract** — _Psychological safety is a key component of healthy and effective organizations, particularly in
high-risk and structured environments such as the federal government. The leadership behaviors
associated with the theory of transformational leadership are important in the ability to
effectively foster a climate of psychological safety. The purpose of this quantitative nonexperimental correlational study was to determine if and to what extent a relationship existed
between supervisors’ transformational leadership behaviors and employees’ psychological safety
climate among U.S. Department of the Navy civilians. A total of 9,160 archival responses from
the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey were analyzed using Spearman’s rank-order correlation
and linear regression. Results revealed significant positive relationships between all
transformational leadership dimensions and psychological safety climate, with the strongest
correlation observed between intellectual stimulation and psychological safety (rs[9160] = .783,p < .001). Regression analysis confirmed that intellectual stimulation had the strongest predictive
power, while individualized consideration also showed moderate predictive strength.
Inspirational motivation and idealized influence, while correlated with psychological safety, did
not significantly contribute to its prediction when considered alongside the other dimensions.
The findings of the study support the role of transformational leadership in building a safe and
inclusive organizational climate in a high-performing government workplace_.
